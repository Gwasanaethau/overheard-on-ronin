###Overhead on Ronin:###

The session involved lots of giggling and lots of Googling!

Remember to check your ham for viruses.

My beautiful digital cohort.

I’m making some tea, anybody want anything?

We’ve got a bit of a bend issue!

Rules are there to be bent, or straightened in our case.

Are you still enjoying this week or have you all completely lost your marbles?

…the ROFLMAO approach to testing.

When my resources are running low, I activate the extra fusion core and generate some more!

I _am_ IRB.

Oh, I’m the turtle…I want to be the koala!

KitKat time!

“I’m in a ranty mood!” “Is that similar to a moody rant? Is that dependency inversion?”

Oh no! I can’t stop the Star Wars!

Let’s display a flash message at the top of the page which notifies the loser…err…*user* of the error.

I’m excited! [said in a very apathetic tone].

JavaB, JavaC, PoshRuby, GingerCucumber & BabySinatra – ‘JavaBuzz – the Spicy Remix’.

These are like actual pills: small and hard to swallow!

I just danced on my keyboard!

I’ll refactor that into something that makes sense in a moment.

You should be able to fit a head in there; you might be able to fit a body too!

“You can do this in Excel, can’t you?” “Yes…yes you can…”

I’m having an Ajax-free evening!

Stop being helpful!

Flex those memories!

Yey! Our tests are broken!

The ugly-RSpec is live!

This Bakers Academy thing is fantastic!

Awesome possom!

You’ll need to use your digits…to submit keyboard-ly.

No, no, after the before…

We’re getting distracted talking about being distracted.
